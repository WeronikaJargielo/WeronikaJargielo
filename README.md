# Let me introduce myself! ðŸ‘‹ 
Hello, my name is @WeronikaJargielo. 
I finished studying Biotechnology with a specialization in Bioinformatics at the Silesian University of Technology. 
During my studies, I've begun my adventure with programming. 
Since I was getting more and more familiar with IT, I wanted to concentrate my career on Web Development.
Currently, I've started looking for a job in IT.

## Knowledge ðŸ˜Ž 
I really like programming in Python :snake: and Java :coffee:.
Iâ€™m currently learning front-end technologies: HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript. 

## My hobbies ðŸ‘€
I love mountain hiking and mountain climbing. 
Also, I'm a happy mother of quite a huge group of home plants. 
In my free time, I really like playing board games and riding a bike.
Lately, I've started going to the gym and lifting weights and I think that it is my new hobby.
