# Let me introduce myself! ðŸ‘‹ 
Hello,
my name is Weronika. 
I finished studying Biotechnology with a specialization in Bioinformatics at the Silesian University of Technology. 
During my studies, I've begun my adventure with programming using mainly Python. 
Then I participated in a meeting that was focused on introducing Java to beginners and I fell in love with this programming language. It was the moment when I decided to focus my career path on IT with a special interest in developing projects with Java.

## My hobbies ðŸ‘€
During my holidays and weekends, I love mountain hiking and mountain climbing. 
Also, I'm a happy mother of quite a huge group of home plants and two little kitties. In my free time, I really like playing board games, riding a bike, and playing the piano, or at least trying since I am learning on my own.
